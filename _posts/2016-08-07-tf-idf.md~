##TF-IDF

TF:term frequency

IDF:inverse document frequency

$idf = log \frac{\#docoument}{1+\#document \space using\space the\space word}$

The main aim of tf-idf is to diminsh the importance of the normal word like 'the','a'.

As you can see above, the more term appear in all documents, the smaller value it gets.

Then, we use $tf * idf$ as the representation of a document.
